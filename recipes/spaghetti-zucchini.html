        <div class="column">
          <ul>
            <li>1 clove garlic</li>
            <li>&frac12; cup olive oil</li>
            <li>5 small zucchini, sliced into very thin rounds</li>
            <li>11 ounces spaghetti</li>
            <li>3 ounces grated Provolone del Monaco (or Parmesan)</li>
            <li>1 knob of cold, unsalted butter</li>
            <li>1 handful basil leaves</li>
          </ul>
        </div>
        <div class="column">
          <ol>
            <li>Put a large pot of water on to boil for the spaghetti.</li>
            <li>
              In a wide skillet over medium-high heat, add the garlic and olive
              oil so the mixture sizzles and the oil gets infused by the garlic.
              When just golden, remove the garlic and add the zucchini rounds.
              Toss every now and then, letting the zucchini fry away until
              tender but not brown.
            </li>
            <li>
              In the meantime, add a teaspoon to salt to the boiling water, then
              place spaghetti in pot.
            </li>
            <li>
              Drain the zucchini on paper towels and season with a pinch of salt
              and some freshly ground pepper. Blend together about a third of
              the zucchini and about &frac14; of water from the pot of pasta.
              Pour this pure&eacute; into a large serving bowl, where you will
              eventually add all the pasta.
            </li>
            <li>
              When the spaghetti is al dente, drain, saving about &frac12; cup
              of the cooking water. Toss the spaghetti into the serving bowl
              with the pure&eacute;, the grated cheese, the fried zucchini, and
              the cold butter. Quickly toss, using tongs or a spatula to help.
              You want spaghetti to be silky and coated with the pure&eacute;,
              not dry but not watery either. If it's too dry, add cooking water
              a little at a time. Top with the basil leaves and serve
              immediately.
