              In a medium saucepan, cook the farro according to the directions
              on the package. Drain well and let cool. (The farro can be made
              ahead of time and refrigerated).
            </li>
            <li>
              In a small bowl, beat the eggs with &frac14; teaspoon of the soy
              sauce and &frac14; teaspoon of the sesame oil.
            </li>
            <li>
              In a large nonstick skillet over medium-high heat, heat 1 teaspoon
              of the peanut oil until shimmering. Add the egg mixture and
              scramble until it sets, 3-4 minutes. Transfer the egg to a plate,
              cut into bite-size pieces and set aside.
            </li>
            <li>
              Wipe the skillet clean, add the remaining 1 tablespoon + 1 teaspon
              peanut oil, and heat over medium-high heat until shimmering. Add
              the carrots and cook, stirring, for 2 minutes. Add the broccoli
              and cook until the vegetables are fork-tender, 3-4 minutes. Stir
              in the garlic, ginger, scallions, and peas and cook for 2 minutes.
              Season with &frac12; teaspoon salt.
            </li>
            <li>
              Using a wooden spoon, push the vegetables to the sides of the
              skillet, making a well in the center. Add the cooked farro to the
              well and gradually mix the vegetables into it.
            </li>
            <li>
              Add the remaining 2 tablespoons + 1 teaspoon soy sauce, the
              remaining 2 teaspoons sesame oil, and the vinegar. Stir in the
              scrambled eggs and mix well.
            </li>
            <li>
              Serve hot, garnished with the scallion greens. Pass the sriracha
              or chili garlic sauce separately, if desired.
