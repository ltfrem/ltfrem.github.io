      <h1>Banana Pudding</h1>
      <div id="servings">
        <p>Makes approximately 12-16 servings.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="row">
        <div class="column">
          <ul>
            <li>1 14oz. can sweetened condensed milk</li>
            <li>1 &frac12; cups ice cold water</li>
            <li>1 3.4oz. package instant vanilla pudding mix</li>
            <li>3 cups cold heavy cream</li>
            <li>1 11oz. box vanilla wafer cookies (such as Nilla)</li>
            <li>4 to 5 ripe bananas, sliced</li>
          </ul>
        </div>
        <div class="column">
          <ol>
            <li>
              In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the whisk attachment,
              beat the condensed milk and water on low speed until blended, then
              increase the speed to medium and whisk until well combined, about
              1 minute. Add the instant pudding mix and beat until there are no
              lumps and the mixture is smooth, about 2 minutes. Transfer the
              mixture to a medium bowl, cover and refrigerate until firm, at
              least 1 hour or overnight.
            </li>
            <li>
              Using the stand mixer with the whisk attachment, whip the heavy
              cream on medium speed for about 1 minute, until the cream starts
              to thicken, then increase the speed to medium-high and whip until
              stiff peaks form. Be careful not to overwhip.
            </li>

            <li>
              With the mixer running on low speed, add the pudding mixture a
              spoonful at a time. Mix until well blended and no streaks of
              pudding remain.
            </li>
            <li>
              To assemble, set aside 4 to 5 cookies, whole or crumbled, for
              garnish. In a 4 to 5 quart trifle bowl or a wide glass bowl (or in
              12 8 ounce bowls or ramekins), spread one-quarter of the pudding
              over the bottom and layer with one-third of the cookies and
              one-third of the sliced bananas (enough to cover the layer).
              Repeat the layering twice more. End with a final layer of pudding.
            </li>
            <li>
              Cover tightly with plastic wrap and refrigerate for 4 to 6 hours.
              COokies should be tender when poked with a knife. This dessert is
              best served within 12 hours of assembling. To serve, garnish the
              top with the reserved cookies or cookie crumbs.
