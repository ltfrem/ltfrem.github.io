        <div class="column">
          <ul>
            <li>1 pound ground beef</li>
            <li>1 medium onion, finely chopped</li>
            <li>1 cup rinsed and drained canned black beans</li>
            <li>1 cup corn, drained, canned or frozen (thawed if frozen)</li>
            <li>1 cup tomato sauce</li>
            <li>1 cup beef or chicken broth</li>
            <li>&frac12; cup diced green bell pepper (optional)</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon chili powder</li>
            <li>&frac12; teaspoon ground cumin</li>
            <li>1 &frac12; teaspoons salt, plus more to taste</li>
            <li>&frac34; cups cornmeal</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon flour</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon sugar</li>
            <li>1 &frac12; teaspoons baking powder</li>
            <li>1 egg</li>
            <li>&frac13; cup milk</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
          </ul>

              Preheat the oven to 425 degrees. Grease a 3-quart high-sided
              casserole dish with cooking spray. In a large skillet,
              saut&eacute; the beef and onion over medium-high heat until the
              meat is brown and the onion translucent, about 10 minutes. Then
              add the beans, corn, tomato sauce, broth, bell pepper (if using),
              chili powder, cumin, 1 teaspoon salt, and &frac14; teaspoon black
              pepper. Simmer for 15 minutes. Set aside.
            </li>
            <li>
              In a medium bowl, whisk together the cornmeal, flour, sugar,
              baking powder, and teaspoon salt. In a small bowl, whisk together
              the egg, milk, and oil until well combined. Whisk the milk mixture
              into the flour mixture until combined. Spread the meat mixture
              into the casserole dish and cover with the corn bread topping. The
              topping will disappear into the meat mixture but will rise during
              baking and form a layer of corn bread. Bake until the corn bread
              is brown, 20 to 25 minutes.
