      <h1>One-Pan Orzo with Spinach and Feta</h1>
      <div id="servings">
        <p>Makes approximately 4 servings.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="row">
        <div class="column">
          <ul>
            <li>2 tablespoons unsaled butter</li>
            <li>4 large scallions, trimmed and thinly sliced</li>
            <li>2 large garlic cloves, minced</li>
            <li>8 ounces baby spinach leaves (8 cups), coarsely chopped</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon kosher salt</li>
            <li>1 &frac34; cups low-sodium chicken or vegetable stock</li>
            <li>1 cup orzo</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon finely grated lemon zest (from 1 lemon)</li>
            <li>
              &frac34; cup crumbled feta (3 ounces), plus more for garnish
            </li>
            <li>&frac12; cup frozen peas, thawed (optional)</li>
            <li>1 cup chopped fresh dill (or parsley or cilantro)</li>
          </ul>
        </div>
        <div class="column">
          <ol>
            <li>
              Heat a 10-inch skillet over medium, then melt butter 30 seconds to
              1 minute. Stir in about three-quarters or the scallions (saving
              some of the green parts for garnish) and garlic, and cook until
              softened, stirring frequently, about 3 minutes.
            </li>
            <li>
              Stir in spinach, adding in batches if it doesn't all fit in the
              pan at once, and &frac12; teaspoon salt. Continue to cook,
              stirring occasionally, until spinach is wilted, about 5 minutes.
            </li>

            <li>
              Stir in stock and bring to a simmer. Stir in orzo, lemon zest, and
              remaining &frac12; teaspoon salt. Cover and simmer over medium-low
              heat until orzo is nearly cooked through and most of the liquid is
              absorbed, 10 to 14 minutes, stirring once or twice.
            </li>
            <li>
              Stir in cheese, peas (if you like), and dill, cover the pan, and
              cook for another minute, to finish cooking and warm the peas. To
              serve, sprinkle with more cheese and the reserved scallions.
