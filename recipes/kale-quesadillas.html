              In a medium nonstick skillet over medium heat, heat 1 tablespoon
              of oil until shimmering. Add the shallot and cook until
              translucent, 2-3 minutes. Add the garlic and cook for an
              additional minute. Add the beans, parsley, &frac14; teaspoon salt,
              and &frac18; teaspoon pepper and mix well. Cook until the beans
              are hot, about 3 minutes. Transfer to a bowl and mash the beans
              with a fork, leaving a few chunks for texture.
            </li>
            <li>
              Wipe out the skillet, returning to medium heat, and add the
              remaining 1 tablespoon olive oil. Once the oil is shimmering, add
              the kale and saut&eacute; until wilted, about 4 minutes. Season
              with salt and pepper. Set aside.
            </li>
            <li>
              In a grill pan or a separate large skillet over medium heat, melt
              a small pat of butter. Place a tortilla in the pan and sprinkle 3
              tablespoons of cheese over the entire tortilla. Cook until the
              cheese has melted, then distribute about 2 tablespoons of the
              white bean mixture and some of the kale over just half the
              tortilla. With a spatula, fold the tortilla in half to sandwich
              the filling. Sprinkle the folded tortilla with a pinch of salt.
              Cook until the bottom is golden brown on the second side, about 1
              minute more. Transfer to a rimmed baking sheet and place in the
              oven to keep warm. Repeat with the remaining tortillas, cheese
              filling, and kale.

              Remove the quesadillas from the oven, cut each in half, and serve
              with salsa.
