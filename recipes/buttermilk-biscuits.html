            <li>1 cup cold buttermilk</li>
            <li>8 tablespoons (1 stick) butter</li>
            <li>2 cups all purpose flour (+ a little extra)</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon sugar</li>
            <li>&frac12; teaspoon baking soda</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons baking powder</li>

              Adjust oven rack to middle position and heat to 450. Spray baking
              sheet with non-stick spray.
            </li>
            <li>
              Measure 1 cup buttermilk and place cup in the freezer while
              prepping other ingredients. You want it to be in the freezer about
              10 minutes.
            </li>
            <li>
              Place butter in microwave-safe bowl, cover with a paper towel and
              heat on high for 30 seconds. If not completely melted, return to
              microwave for 10 second intervals until melted. Set aside to cool
              a bit while prepping other ingredients.
            </li>
            <li>
              Whisk flour, baking soda, baking powder, sugar, and salt in a
              large bowl.
            </li>
            <li>
              After buttermilk has been chilled in the freezer for 10 minutes,
              combine it with the melted butter. Stir with a fork until butter
              forms small clumps or globules.
            </li>
            <li>
              Add buttermilk mixture to dry ingredients and stir with rubber
              spatula just until all flour is incorporated and batter pulls away
              from sides of bowl. Dough should be stiff and not super wet. If
              dough is wet, add more flour 1 tablespoon at a time, stirring to
              combine, until dough is fairly stiff.
            </li>
            <li>
              Generously flour a work surface. Dump biscuit dough from bowl onto
              prepared work surface and turn to coat all surfaces with flour.
              Knead on counter and drop onto baking sheet approximately 1 inch
              apart.
            </li>
            <li>
              Place in oven and bake until tops are golden brown and crisp, 8-18
              minutes. Start checking them after 8 minutes as ovens vary; you
              want them to be a nice golden brown but not too brown.
