            <ul>
              <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
              <li>16 oz. cherry tomatoes</li>
              <li>6 cloves garlic, chopped</li>
              <li>2 teaspoons agave syrup (optional)</li>
              <li>3 cups vegetable or chicken broth</li>
              <li>1 cup milk</li>
              <li>1 can full fat coconut milk</li>
              <li>2 tablespoons nutritional yeast</li>
              <li>2 tablespoons corn starch</li>
              <li>2 tablespoons water</li>
              <li>16 oz. pasta of choice (linguine preferred)</li>
              <li>1 cup fresh basil, chopped</li>
              <li>parmesan cheese for topping (optional)</li>
              <li>salt and pepper to taste</li>
          </ul>
        </div>
        <div class="column">
          <ol>
            <li>In a large pot, heat the olive oil on medium high. Then add the cherry tomatoes and chopped garlic. Saut&eacute;, reducing heat as needed for 2-3 minutes or until the tomatoes start to burst. Season with a pinch of salt and pepper. Then add the agave syrup if using. This helps them caramelize and makes them sweet and delicious. </li>
            <li>Continue to saut&eacute; for another 2-3 minutes or until the tomatoes are a little brown and have all burst.</li>
            <li>Remove the tomatoes and garlic from the pot, put in a bowl and set aside.</li>
            <li>Now, add the vegetable broth, milk, and coconut milk to the pot. Stir and then saeson with a few pinches of salt and pepper and the nutritional yeast. Stir to combine.</li>
            <li>Next, add the pasta to the boiling pot of liquid. If using long noodles, I like to break them in half. Stir the pasta into the pot. Simmer, reducing heat if needed until the pasta is done (check package for direcitons). When the pasta is done, it should have absorbed most of the liquid and it should be nice and creamy.</li>
            <li>Once the pasta is done (don't drain!), taste and adjust seasoning; you may need more salt and pepper.</li>
            <li>Add the caramelized tomatoes and chopped fresh basil into the pasta. Stir to combine, taste one more time, and adjust seasoning. Add a squeeze of lemon juice if you'd like and top with cheese (optional).</li>
