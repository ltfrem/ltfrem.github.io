          <h6>For the kale pesto:</h6>
          <ol>

            <li>In a dry skillet over medium-high heat, toast the walnuts, shaking the pan and stirring until they begin to brown, 3-5 minutes. Transfer to a plate and let cool.</li>
<li>In a food processor or blender, pulse the kale in batches until roughly chopped. Add the cooled walnuts and garlic and pulse to combine. Scrape down the sides with a rubber spatula and add the Parmesan cheese, &frac12; teaspoon salt, and &frac14; teaspoon pepper. Pulse until smooth. With the motor running, slowly drizzle in the olive oil and pulse to combine. Set aside.</li>
          </ol>
          <h6>For the chicken:</h6>
          <ol>
            <li>Set a rack in the upper third of the oven and preheat to 400.</li>
            <li>In a small saucepan over medium-low heat, heat the oil. Add the garlic and cook for 1 &frac12; minutes. Remove from the heat and stir in the vermouth, lemon zest, lemon juice, &frac12; teaspoon salt, and &frac18; teaspoon pepper. Pour the sauce into a 9x13-inch casserole or baking dish.</li>
            <li>Blot any excess moisture from the chicken breasts and season them liberally with salt and pepper. Place the chicken skin-side up in the sauce. Cover each chicken breast with 1 tablespoon of pesto, spreading it evenly. Bake the chicken for 30-40 minutes, until the internal temperature registers 165 on an instant-read thermometer. Remove from oven and switch the oven to broil.</li>
            <li>Sprinkle each breast with 1 tablespoon of the Parmesan cheese. Broil for 2 minutes, or until the pesto is bubbling and the cheese has melted. Serve the chicken with the pan juices drizzled over the top and garnished with the lemon wedges.</li>
            <li>Note: To store the remaining pesto for later use, transfer to an airtight container and top with 2-3 tablespoons olive oil. Store in the refrigerator for 7-10 days or freeze for up to 6 months.</li>
