            <ul>
            <li>&frac34; lb ground turkey</li>
            <li>&frac34; cup whole-milk ricotta cheese</li>
            <li>&frac14; cup grated parmesan, plus more for serving</li>
            <li>&frac14; cup chopped sun-dried tomatoes packed in olive oil, drained and reserved</li>
            <li>3 garlic cloves, minced or grated</li>
            <li>2 tsp dried oregano</li>
            <li>1 24oz jar marinana sauce</li>
            <li>&frac14; cup balsamic vinegar</li>
            <li>3 large eggs, beaten</li>
            <li>&frac34; pound short-cut pasta of choice</li>
            <li>crushed red pepper flakes</li>
            <li>8 oz low moisture mozzarella, torn</li>
            <li>&frac14; cup fresh basil leaves, slivered</li>
          </ul>

            <li>Preheat the oven to 375.</li>
<li><b>Make the meatballs.</b> In a medium bowl, combine the turkey, ricotta, parmesan, sun-dried tomatoes, 1 garlic clove, 1 tsp of the oregano, and a pinch each of salt and pepper. Using your hands, mix well to combine. Grease your hands with a bit of olive oil and roll the meat into 16 2-tablespoon-size balls, placing them in a 9x13 baking dish.</li>

            <li>Drizzle the reserved sun-dried tomato oil over the meatballs and place the baking dish in the oven. Bake until the meatballs are crisp on the outside but not yet cooked through, about 10 minutes. Remove the dish from the oven, but leave the oven on.</li>
            <li><b>Make the sauce.</b> Meanwhile, in a large bowl, combine the marinara sauce, 2 cups of water, the vinegar, eggs, the remaining 2 garlic cloves, the remaining 1 teaspoon of oregano, the pasta, and a pinch of red pepper flakes.</li>
            <li>Pour the pasta and tomato sauce mixture around the meatballs, gently stirring to distribute. Sprinkle the mozzarella over the top. Cover the baking dish with aluminum foil and bake until the sauce has thickened and the noodles have cooked, about 40 minutes more. Turn the oven to broil, remove the foil, and cook until the top of the bake is golden brown, about 5 minutes.</li>
            <li>Let the bake cool for 5 minutes, then top with fresh basil and serve.</li>
