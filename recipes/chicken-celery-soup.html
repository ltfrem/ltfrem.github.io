      <h1>Chicken and Rice Soup</h1>
      <div id="servings">
        <p>Makes 4 to 6 servings.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="row">
        <div class="column">
          <ul>
            <li>8 cups chicken broth</li>
            <li>1 pound boneless, skinless chicken thighs (or breasts)</li>
            <li>4 celery stalks, leaves reserved and stalks thinly sliced</li>
            <li>&frac34; cup jasmine rice (unrinsed)</li>
            <li>&frac12; cup fresh parsley leaves</li>
            <li>
              1 teaspoon fresh lemon zest plus up to &frac12; cup lemon juice (2
              to 3 lemons)
            </li>
            <li>1 small garlic clove</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon unsalted butter (optional)</li>
          </ul>
        </div>
        <div class="column">
          <ol>
            <li>
              In a large pot, combine the broth, chicken, celery, and rice.
              Season lightly with salt. Bring to a simmer over medium-high heat,
              then reduce heat and simmer until the chicken is cooked through
              and the rice starts to break down and lose its shape, 20-30
              minutes.
            </li>
            <li>
              Meanwhile, finely chop together the parsley leaves, lemon zest and
              up to &frac12; cup celery leaves. Transfer to a small bowl, grate
              the garlic clove into the bowl, season with salt and stir to
              combine.
            </li>
            <li>
              Using tongs, remove the chicken from the pot and transfer to a
              medium bowl. Using two forks, shred the chicken into pieces, then
              stir it back into the soup. Remove from heat, stir in the butter
              (if using), and season to taste with salt. Stir in the lemon juice
              a little at a time until the soup is bright but still tastes like
              chicken.
            </li>
            <li>
              Divide the soup among bowls and top with the parsley-lemon
              mixture. (The soup, minus the lemon juice and parsley mixture, can
              be refrigerated for up to 3 days; the rice will absorb liquid as
              it sits, so add more chicken broth when reheating. Add the lemon
              juice and fresh herb garnish just before serving.)
